    { question: "I'm a tourist in Manchester and have a dental emergency. What should I do first?", answer: "The first step is to call a private emergency dental clinic like ours. Explain that you are a visitor. We are experienced in helping tourists and can provide advice over the phone and arrange a prompt appointment if needed." },
    { question: "Can I use the NHS for a dental emergency as a tourist?", answer: "Access to NHS dental care for tourists can be complicated and may involve long waits. Some visitors may be entitled to it, but many are not. Private emergency care is the fastest and most reliable way to be seen and treated quickly." },
    { question: "How much will an emergency dental appointment cost for a visitor?", answer: "As a private clinic, we have standard fees for an emergency consultation, and any treatment required is an additional cost. We are fully transparent about all fees. We can provide you with a detailed receipt to claim back from your travel insurance." },
    { question: "Will you accept my travel insurance?", answer: "Patients typically pay for their treatment at the time of the appointment. We will provide you with all the necessary documentation, including a detailed invoice and treatment summary, for you to submit a claim to your travel insurance provider for reimbursement." },
    { question: "I've broken a tooth. Can you fix it on the same day so I can enjoy my trip?", answer: "In many cases, yes. For a broken front tooth, we can often perform a cosmetic bonding repair in a single visit. For more complex issues, our goal is to get you out of pain and provide a stable temporary solution so you can continue your holiday with minimal disruption." },
    { question: "What information should I have ready when I call?", answer: "It's helpful to have the address of where you are staying in Manchester, a contact phone number, and any details about your travel insurance (though this is not essential for booking). Most importantly, be ready to clearly describe your symptoms." },
    { question: "What if I need follow-up treatment or medication?", answer: "We can provide private prescriptions for medication like antibiotics or strong painkillers, which you can fill at any local pharmacy. If you need follow-up care, we will provide a full report for your home dentist to ensure continuity of care when you return." },
    { question: "I don't know my way around Manchester. How can I find your clinic?", answer: "Our address is listed on our website, and we are easily found on Google Maps. Manchester has excellent public transport and taxi services like Uber that can bring you directly to our clinic." },
    { question: "Do I need to be registered with a dentist in the UK to see you?", answer: "No, not at all. Our emergency service is available to everyone, including temporary visitors and tourists, with no registration required." },
    { question: "What are the most common dental emergencies you see in tourists?", answer: "We often see lost fillings or crowns, broken teeth from accidents, and sudden, severe toothaches or infections that have flared up during travel." }
