Learn what to expect from an emergency root canal in Bolton.",author:"Dr. Ben Carter",readTime:"9 min read",category:"Treatments",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591123720169-2602f65b9a1a",imgAlt:"A high-tech dental microscope used for precision endodontic treatments like root canals."},s=[{question:"Why would I need an emergency root canal?",answer:"You'd need one if the pulp (the soft tissue inside your tooth containing nerves and blood vessels) becomes inflamed or infected. This is often caused by deep decay, a large filling, a crack in the tooth, or trauma. The result is often a severe, throbbing toothache."},{question:"Is a root canal treatment painful?",answer:"No. This is the biggest misconception in dentistry. The pain you feel is from the infection *before* the treatment. The root canal procedure itself is performed under local anesthetic, so you won't feel any pain. The treatment is what relieves the pain."},{question:"What is the purpose of a root canal?",answer:"The purpose is to save your natural tooth and prevent the need for extraction. The procedure removes the infected or inflamed pulp, cleans and disinfects the inside of the tooth, and then fills and seals it."},{question:"How long does an emergency root canal take?",answer:"An emergency appointment focuses on getting you out of pain. This first stage can take around 60-90 minutes. A full root canal treatment may require one or two appointments depending on the complexity and extent of the infection."},{question:"What are the steps of the procedure?",answer:"First, we numb the tooth completely. A small protective sheet called a 'rubber dam' is placed to keep the tooth clean. We then make a small opening in the tooth, remove the damaged pulp, clean and shape the root canals, and fill them with a rubber-like material called gutta-percha. Finally, a temporary or permanent filling is placed."},{question:"What happens after the first emergency appointment?",answer:"At the first visit, we'll do the most important part: removing the infected nerve tissue to stop the pain. We'll place a temporary filling, and you'll need to return for a second appointment to have the permanent filling and usually a crown placed."},{question:"Why do I need a crown after a root canal?",answer:"A tooth that has had a root canal is more brittle and prone to fracture than a healthy tooth. A crown is a protective cap that covers the tooth, restoring its strength and function and protecting it for the long term."},{question:"What is the alternative to a root canal?",answer:"The only alternative to a root canal is extracting the tooth. While sometimes necessary, we always prefer to save your natural tooth whenever possible. Losing a tooth can lead to other problems like shifting teeth or bone loss."},{question:"How will I feel after the procedure?",answer:"Once the anesthetic wears off, the tooth may be a little tender for a few days, which is easily managed with over-the-counter painkillers. The severe, throbbing pain from the infection will be gone."},{question:"I'm in Bolton and in severe pain. How quickly can you help?",answer:"If you have symptoms of needing a root canal, like severe toothache, swelling, or a pimple on your gum, contact our Bolton emergency service immediately. We will arrange to see you the same day to get you out of pain."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(n.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(o,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(r,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:`Few phrases in dentistry cause as much unnecessary fear as "root canal."
