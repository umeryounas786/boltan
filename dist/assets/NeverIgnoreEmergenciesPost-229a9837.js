If it's from an injury, it needs to be stabilized immediately to save it. If it's from gum disease, it indicates severe bone loss that requires urgent treatment to prevent tooth loss."},{question:"My toothache comes and goes. Is it still serious?",answer:"Yes. A toothache that subsides doesn't mean the problem has fixed itself. It often indicates the nerve inside the tooth is dying. The infection is likely still present and can lead to a painful abscess if left untreated."},{question:"What are the dangers of bleeding gums?",answer:"While minor bleeding from vigorous flossing can happen, persistent, spontaneous, or heavy bleeding from your gums is a classic sign of gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). Ignoring it can lead to bone loss, receding gums, and eventual tooth loss."},{question:"I have a metallic taste in my mouth. What could it be?",answer:"A metallic taste can sometimes be a sign of a cracked or leaking old metal (amalgam) filling. This means bacteria can get underneath the filling, causing decay in the tooth that you can't see. It needs to be assessed and likely replaced."},{question:"Why is a broken tooth an emergency even if it doesn't hurt?",answer:"A broken tooth has lost its protective outer layer of enamel. This makes it vulnerable to rapid decay and infection. The fracture can also spread deeper into the tooth under normal chewing pressure, potentially leading to a situation where the tooth cannot be saved."},{question:"Can a dental abscess go away on its own?",answer:"No, never. A dental abscess is a serious infection that requires professional draining and treatment (like a root canal or extraction). If the pain stops, it may mean the abscess has ruptured and the infection is spreading, which is even more dangerous."},{question:"Is jaw pain a dental emergency?",answer:"Persistent jaw pain, especially when accompanied by clicking, popping, or difficulty opening your mouth, can be a sign of Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) disorder or issues with your bite. While not always an 'emergency' in the same way as an abscess, it requires prompt dental evaluation to prevent long-term problems."},{question:"What if I just have a small chip on a back tooth?",answer:"Even a small chip on a molar should be checked. It creates a rough surface that can trap plaque and be difficult to clean, leading to decay. It can also weaken the tooth structure, making it more likely to fracture further."},{question:"How can I tell the difference between sensitivity and a real problem?",answer:"Lingering pain is the key. If sensitivity to hot or cold lasts for more than a few seconds after the stimulus is gone, it's often a sign that the nerve is irritated or infected and needs to be checked."},{question:"If I have one of these signs, what should I do?",answer:"Do not wait to see if it gets better. Call our emergency dental clinic in Manchester immediately. Explain your symptoms clearly. Prompt action is the best way to save your tooth, prevent complications, and minimize treatment costs."}],c=()=>e.jsxs(a.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(s,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(o,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(i,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"It's easy to dismiss a minor toothache or a little bleeding from your gums, hoping it will just go away.
