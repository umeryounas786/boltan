Toothaches from decay or infection are also very frequent."},{question:"What should I do if my child knocks out a permanent tooth?",answer:"Act quickly! Find the tooth and hold it by the crown (the chewing surface), not the root. If it's dirty, rinse it gently with milk or water (do not scrub). Try to reinsert it into the socket. If you can't, place it in a container of milk or saliva and get to our emergency clinic immediately. Time is critical."},{question:"What about a knocked-out baby tooth?",answer:"Do not try to reinsert a baby tooth. This can damage the developing permanent tooth underneath. Find the tooth if you can to ensure it wasn't swallowed or inhaled, and contact us for an assessment."},{question:"How can I help my child's toothache?",answer:"Have your child rinse their mouth with warm salt water. You can use a cold compress on their cheek to reduce swelling. Never place aspirin directly on the gums. Give age-appropriate pain relief like paracetamol or ibuprofen, and schedule an emergency visit with us."},{question:"My child chipped a tooth, is it an emergency?",answer:"Yes, even small chips should be evaluated. A chip can have sharp edges that cut the lips or tongue, and deeper fractures can expose the tooth's nerve. Collect any broken fragments and call us for an appointment."},{question:"What should I do for a cut lip or tongue?",answer:"Clean the area gently with a cloth and apply a cold compress to reduce swelling. If bleeding is heavy or doesn't stop with light pressure after 15-20 minutes, go to an urgent care center or A&E, as stitches may be needed."},{question:"How can we prevent dental injuries during sports?",answer:"A custom-fitted mouthguard is the best protection against dental injuries during sports. It's a small investment that can save you from significant pain, trauma, and expense. We can create one for your child here at the clinic."},{question:"Is a dental abscess in a child serious?",answer:"Yes, a dental abscess (a pimple-like swelling on the gum) is a sign of infection and is a serious emergency. The infection can spread and cause significant health problems. Contact us immediately; do not try to pop the abscess."},{question:"How do you make children feel comfortable during an emergency visit?",answer:"Our team is specially trained to work with children. We use a 'tell-show-do' approach, explaining things in simple terms and using a friendly, reassuring tone. Our goal is to make the visit as positive and stress-free as possible."},{question:"When should I take my child to A&E vs. an emergency dentist?",answer:"Go to the A&E for a suspected jaw fracture, uncontrollable bleeding, or if your child has lost consciousness or has other significant head injuries. For all other tooth-related emergencies (knocked-out tooth, abscess, severe pain), an emergency dentist is the best choice."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(i.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(n,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(o,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"As a parent, seeing your child in pain or distress is one of the most difficult experiences.
