Our guide explains why it might be necessary and what to expect during a comfortable, pain-free procedure.",author:"Dr. Ben Carter",readTime:"8 min read",category:"Treatments",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629904853716-f0bc54eea48d",imgAlt:"A calm and modern dental clinic room prepared for a procedure."},s=[{question:"Why would I need an emergency tooth extraction?",answer:"An emergency extraction is a last resort, typically needed when a tooth is too damaged to be saved. This can be due to severe trauma (a major fracture), advanced and untreatable decay, a failed root canal, or a severe infection/abscess that has destroyed too much of the surrounding bone."},{question:"Will the extraction hurt?",answer:"No. This is the most common concern, and the answer is definitive. The procedure is performed under powerful local anesthetic, which completely numbs the tooth and the surrounding area. You will feel some pressure, but you will not feel any pain."},{question:"What is the process of an emergency extraction?",answer:"First, we take an X-ray to plan the procedure. Then, we administer the local anesthetic and wait for it to take full effect. The dentist then gently loosens the tooth and removes it. Finally, we place sterile gauze over the socket and have you bite down to control bleeding."},{question:"What about sedation? Can I be asleep?",answer:"We offer sedation options like oral sedation or nitrous oxide for anxious patients. These will put you in a state of deep relaxation, but you will still be conscious. This is not the same as general anesthesia, but it makes the experience much more comfortable for those with dental fear."},{question:"How long does the procedure take?",answer:"A simple extraction is a surprisingly quick procedure, often taking only 20-30 minutes from start to finish, including the time for the anesthetic to work."},{question:"What is recovery like after an extraction?",answer:"You can expect some mild discomfort and swelling for a few days, which is easily managed with over-the-counter painkillers. We will provide you with detailed aftercare instructions, including what to eat and how to keep the area clean."},{question:"What is a dry socket and how can I avoid it?",answer:"A dry socket is a painful condition that occurs if the blood clot in the socket dislodges prematurely. To avoid it, you must not smoke, drink through a straw, or rinse your mouth vigorously for the first 24-48 hours. Following our aftercare instructions is key."},{question:"How long do I need to take off work?",answer:"For a simple extraction, most people feel well enough to return to work the next day, as long as their job isn't physically strenuous. We recommend taking it easy for at least 24 hours."},{question:"What are my options for replacing the extracted tooth?",answer:"It's important to replace a missing tooth to prevent other teeth from shifting. Options include a dental implant (the best long-term solution), a dental bridge, or a partial denture. We can discuss these with you at your appointment."},{question:"I'm in Bolton and need a tooth out urgently. How fast can you help?",answer:"If you are in severe pain from a non-restorable tooth, call our Bolton emergency line. We will arrange to see you the same day to assess the situation and, if extraction is necessary, get you out of pain."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(o.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(a,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(r,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(n,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"Hearing that you need a tooth extracted can be intimidating, especially during a stressful emergency.
