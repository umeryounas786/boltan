Learn immediate at-home remedies for relief and understand the signs that mean you need an emergency wisdom tooth removal in Manchester.",author:"Dr. Anya Sharma",readTime:"8 min read",category:"Pain Management",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1619451439344-a0c4a8993c47",imgAlt:"A person holding their jaw in discomfort, illustrating the severe pain from a wisdom tooth."},r=[{question:"What causes wisdom tooth pain?",answer:"Pain is often caused by the tooth erupting at an angle (impaction), pressing against other teeth. It can also be due to pericoronitis, an infection of the gum flap over a partially erupted wisdom tooth, or decay, as they are hard to clean."},{question:"What can I do for immediate pain relief at home?",answer:"Rinsing with warm salt water can clean the area and soothe gums. Applying a cold compress to your cheek for 15-20 minutes can reduce inflammation and numb the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen are also effective."},{question:"What is pericoronitis and is it an emergency?",answer:"Pericoronitis is the inflammation and infection of the gum tissue around a wisdom tooth. Symptoms include red, swollen gums, pain, a bad taste, and difficulty opening your jaw. It is an emergency as the infection can spread and become serious."},{question:"When do I need to see an emergency dentist for wisdom tooth pain?",answer:"You should call us immediately if you have severe, throbbing pain, swelling in your cheek or jaw, difficulty opening your mouth or swallowing, a fever, or pus draining from the area. These are signs of a significant infection."},{question:"Will I need my wisdom tooth removed?",answer:"Not always. If the pain is from a minor gum infection, a thorough professional cleaning of the area and a course of antibiotics may solve the problem. However, if the tooth is impacted, causing repeated infections, or damaging other teeth, extraction is often the best long-term solution."},{question:"What happens during an emergency wisdom tooth appointment?",answer:"We will take an X-ray (an OPG) to see the position of the tooth and surrounding structures. We will diagnose the cause of your pain, clean the infected area, and provide prescriptions for antibiotics and/or strong painkillers if needed. We will then discuss the need for extraction."},{question:"Is wisdom tooth removal painful?",answer:"No. The procedure itself is not painful as it's performed under local anesthetic, which completely numbs the area. We also offer sedation for anxious patients. You can expect some soreness and swelling during the recovery period, which is manageable with painkillers."},{question:"How long is the recovery after an extraction?",answer:"Initial recovery takes a few days. We recommend taking it easy for 24-48 hours. Swelling and discomfort usually peak around day three and then subside. We will provide you with detailed aftercare instructions to ensure a smooth recovery."},{question:"Can you remove all four wisdom teeth at once?",answer:"This is typically done by an oral surgeon under general anesthetic or deep sedation. In an emergency setting, we focus on removing the one tooth that is causing the immediate problem to provide relief."},{question:"I live in Manchester, how quickly can you help with my wisdom tooth pain?",answer:"As a dedicated emergency clinic in Manchester, we aim to see patients with severe wisdom tooth pain on the same day.
