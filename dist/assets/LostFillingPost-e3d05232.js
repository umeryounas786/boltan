Hereâ€™s Your Step-by-Step Guide",description:"Losing a filling or crown can be alarming. Follow our step-by-step guide on what to do next, including temporary fixes and why you need to see an emergency dentist.",author:"Dr. Chloe Davis",readTime:"6 min read",category:"Dental Repairs",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606636660488-5276535544d3",imgAlt:"A dental crown and professional tools on a sterile tray, ready for a procedure."},s=[{question:"Why did my filling or crown fall out?",answer:"Restorations can come loose for several reasons: new decay forming underneath it, biting down on very hard or sticky food, trauma to the tooth, or simply the age of the restoration. The dental cement holding it in place can also wash out over time."},{question:"Is a lost filling or crown a dental emergency?",answer:"Yes. The underlying tooth structure is now exposed and vulnerable to decay, fracture, and sensitivity. You should see an emergency dentist as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours, to prevent further damage."},{question:"What should I do with the crown if I find it?",answer:"If you have the crown, keep it in a safe place (like a small container or zip-lock bag) and bring it with you to your appointment. Do not try to re-glue it yourself with household adhesives like superglue, as this can damage the crown and your tooth."},{question:"How can I manage the pain or sensitivity?",answer:"You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or paracetamol. Avoid chewing on that side of your mouth. Rinsing with warm salt water can help keep the area clean. You can also apply a small amount of clove oil with a cotton swab for temporary relief."},{question:"Is there anything I can use to cover the tooth temporarily?",answer:"Yes, you can buy temporary dental cement or filling material from most pharmacies. This can be used to cover the exposed tooth or even temporarily stick a crown back in place. This is only a very short-term solution until you can see us."},{question:"Can the original crown be re-cemented?",answer:"Often, yes. If the crown still fits well and both the crown and the underlying tooth are undamaged and free of decay, we can simply re-cement it for you. This is the quickest and most cost-effective solution."},{question:"What if the old crown can't be used?",answer:"If the crown is damaged, doesn't fit anymore, or there is decay on the tooth underneath, you will need a new crown. We will need to prepare the tooth and take a new impression to have a new crown custom-made."},{question:"What happens if I just leave it?",answer:"Leaving the tooth exposed is a bad idea. The tooth can decay rapidly, fracture, or shift position, which could affect your bite and require more extensive and expensive treatment (like a root canal or even extraction) later on."},{question:"How do you replace a lost filling?",answer:"The process is straightforward. We will clean out the area, remove any decay, and place a new filling. We use modern, tooth-coloured composite materials that provide a strong and aesthetic result."},{question:"How can I prevent this from happening again?",answer:"Maintain excellent oral hygiene by brushing and flossing daily, and attend regular dental check-ups. Avoid chewing on extremely hard items like ice or hard candy. If you grind your teeth at night, ask us about a custom night guard to protect your restorations."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(t.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(n,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:o.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:o.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:o.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:o.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(r,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:o.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:o.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"You're eating a meal, and suddenly you feel something hard in your food that definitely shouldn't be there.
