This guide explains the immediate steps to take and how we provide gentle, child-focused emergency care.",author:"Dr. Chloe Davis",readTime:"7 min read",category:"Pediatric Care",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546521593-528e06254146",imgAlt:"A happy, smiling child pointing to their healthy teeth."},r=[{question:"My child just chipped a tooth. What's the very first thing I should do?",answer:"First, stay calm to reassure your child. Have them rinse their mouth with warm water to clean the area. If you can find the chipped fragment, place it in milk or saliva and bring it with you. Apply a cold compress to their face to reduce any swelling."},{question:"Is a small chip on a baby tooth still an emergency?",answer:"Yes. Even small chips should be evaluated by a dentist. A sharp edge could cut your child's lip or tongue, and the damage could hide a deeper crack. We need to ensure the nerve isn't at risk and smooth any sharp edges."},{question:"How do you fix a chipped tooth for a child?",answer:"For most chips, we use a simple and painless procedure called dental bonding. We apply a tooth-coloured composite resin to the tooth and sculpt it to match the original shape. It's quick and provides a great-looking result."},{question:"Will my child need an injection for the repair?",answer:"For most simple bonding procedures on a chipped tooth, no anesthetic injection is needed, as the work is on the outer enamel layer. If the chip is very deep and close to the nerve, we will ensure your child is completely numb and comfortable before we begin."},{question:"What if the chip is on a permanent adult tooth?",answer:"The treatment is similar (usually bonding), but the urgency is just as high. We want to protect the permanent tooth from further damage and ensure its long-term health and appearance. The same first-aid steps apply."},{question:"How can I manage my child's pain?",answer:"You can give them age-appropriate pain relief, such as children's paracetamol or ibuprofen. A cold compress on the cheek is also very effective. Avoid giving them very hot, cold, or hard foods until they've been seen by a dentist."},{question:"How do you handle a child who is scared or anxious?",answer:"Our team is highly experienced with pediatric patients. We use a friendly, gentle approach, explaining what we're doing in simple terms ('tell-show-do'). Our goal is to build trust and make the visit a positive, non-threatening experience."},{question:"Can a chipped tooth lead to other problems if left untreated?",answer:"Yes. A chip can weaken the tooth, making it more susceptible to a larger fracture. It can also expose the inner dentin layer, leading to sensitivity, or allow bacteria to enter, potentially causing an infection or abscess down the line."},{question:"How can I prevent my child from chipping their teeth?",answer:"While accidents happen, the best prevention for sports-related injuries is a custom-fitted mouthguard. Also, discourage habits like chewing on ice, pens, or other hard objects."},{question:"My child's chipped tooth has turned dark. What does that mean?",answer:"A tooth turning grey or dark after trauma can indicate that the nerve inside the tooth has been damaged or has died. This requires an urgent dental assessment, as the tooth may need further treatment, like a pediatric root canal, to prevent infection."}],c=()=>e.jsxs(i.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(a,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(s,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(o,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"The sound of a fall on the playground followed by tears is a moment every parent dreads.
