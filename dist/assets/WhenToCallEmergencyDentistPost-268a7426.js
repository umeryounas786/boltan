This guide covers 7 critical signs that mean you need to call an emergency dentist in Manchester immediately.",author:"Dr. Anya Sharma",readTime:"8 min read",category:"Patient Education",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1576091160550-2173dba9996a",imgAlt:"A person holding a phone, looking concerned, about to call for an emergency."},r=[{question:"What is the number one sign I need an emergency dentist?",answer:"Severe, persistent, and throbbing pain that isn't relieved by painkillers is the most common and urgent sign. It indicates a serious underlying problem like an infection or abscess that needs immediate attention."},{question:"My face is swollen. How serious is this?",answer:"Facial swelling is a major red flag for a dental abscess, which is a serious infection. You should contact an emergency dentist in Manchester immediately. If swelling affects your breathing or swallowing, go to A&E straight away."},{question:"I knocked my tooth out. Can it be saved?",answer:"Yes, but time is critical. Find the tooth, hold it by the crown (the white part), and if clean, try to reinsert it into the socket. If not, store it in milk or saliva and call us immediately. The sooner you act, the higher the chance of saving it."},{question:"Is a loose adult tooth an emergency?",answer:"Yes. An adult tooth should never be loose. It could be a sign of advanced gum disease or trauma. Seeking immediate care can often prevent the tooth from being lost completely."},{question:"What if I have bleeding from my mouth that won't stop?",answer:"Uncontrolled bleeding after an injury or extraction is a definite emergency. Apply firm, consistent pressure with a clean gauze or cloth and call your emergency dentist. If bleeding is severe, consider going to A&E."},{question:"I have a bad taste in my mouth and a bump on my gum. What is it?",answer:"This is a classic sign of a dental abscess. The bump (or fistula) is a channel draining pus from an infection at the root of the tooth. It requires urgent treatment to prevent the infection from spreading."},{question:"I had an accident and my jaw hurts. Is this a dental emergency?",answer:"Yes. Any significant trauma to the mouth or jaw requires an emergency assessment. You could have a fractured or dislocated jaw, which needs immediate medical and dental attention."},{question:"Can I just wait and see if the pain goes away?",answer:"This is never a good idea. Dental pain, especially severe pain, is a sign of an underlying problem that will not resolve on its own. Waiting often leads to more complex, painful, and expensive treatments later."},{question:"What if my emergency happens on a weekend in Manchester?",answer:"Our emergency dental service operates on weekends. We are a reliable weekend dentist in Manchester, ready to handle your urgent needs when other clinics are closed."},{question:"I'm looking for a 'dental emergency near me'. How do I know you're the right choice?",answer:"We specialize in urgent dental care, meaning our systems are built for speed and efficiency. We serve the entire Greater Manchester area, including Bolton, Bury, and Radcliffe, ensuring you get expert care quickly."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(n.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(a,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(o,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(i,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"It can be difficult to know what constitutes a true dental emergency.
