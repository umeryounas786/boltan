We explain the key differences between urgent care and a routine check-up to help you make the right call.",author:"Dr. Chloe Davis",readTime:"8 min read",category:"Patient Education",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526256262350-7da7584cf5eb",imgAlt:"A split image showing a dental emergency on one side and a routine check-up on the other."},r=[{question:"What is the main goal of an urgent care visit?",answer:"The primary goal of an urgent care visit is to address an immediate problem, primarily to get you out of pain, manage an infection, or repair trauma. It's focused on resolving the acute issue at hand."},{question:"What is the main goal of a routine dental visit?",answer:"The goal of a routine visit (a check-up and clean) is prevention. It's about identifying and addressing potential problems before they become painful emergencies and maintaining your overall oral health."},{question:"Is a chipped tooth that doesn't hurt an emergency?",answer:"It's considered urgent, but not necessarily a 'drop everything' emergency unless it's sharp and cutting your mouth. It needs to be seen promptly (within a day or two) to prevent further damage or decay, but it's different from a severe, painful abscess."},{question:"I have a dull, occasional toothache. Is that urgent?",answer:"This is a grey area. While not a severe emergency, it's a clear warning sign. You should book an appointment promptly. If it suddenly becomes severe, throbbing, or constant, it has escalated into a true emergency."},{question:"What are clear signs of a true dental emergency?",answer:"Uncontrolled bleeding, severe pain that isn't managed by painkillers, a knocked-out tooth, or swelling of the face, jaw, or gums. These conditions require immediate attention."},{question:"Can I get a full check-up and clean during my emergency appointment?",answer:"No. The emergency appointment is dedicated to diagnosing and resolving your specific urgent problem. A comprehensive check-up and cleaning is a separate, routine appointment that can be scheduled once the emergency is resolved."},{question:"Why can't I just wait for my next routine check-up to mention my toothache?",answer:"Because a toothache is a sign that damage is already occurring. Waiting weeks or months for a routine visit can allow a small cavity to turn into a root canal problem, or a minor infection to become a major abscess."},{question:"Is the cost different for urgent vs. routine care?",answer:"Yes. Urgent care appointments, especially out-of-hours, may have a different fee structure. The treatment itself is costed based on what is needed to resolve the problem (e.g., an extraction, a root canal dressing). Routine care has standard fees for exams and cleans."},{question:"My crown fell off but it doesn't hurt. How quickly should I be seen?",answer:"This is urgent. The underlying tooth is exposed and vulnerable. You should aim to be seen within 24-48 hours to have the crown re-cemented and prevent damage or decay to the tooth."},{question:"If I'm ever in doubt, what should I do?",answer:"Always call us. It costs nothing to ask. Our team can listen to your symptoms over the phone and give you professional advice on whether you need to be seen urgently or if it's safe to book a regular appointment."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(n.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(s,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(o,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"When a dental problem arises, it can be hard to know how serious it is.
