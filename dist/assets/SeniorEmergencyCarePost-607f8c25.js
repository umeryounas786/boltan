This guide covers common emergencies like lost dentures and broken fillings, and how we provide gentle, prompt care.",author:"Dr. Anya Sharma",readTime:"8 min read",category:"Senior Care",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1592890287445-f2410770827f",imgAlt:"A senior patient smiling comfortably in a dental chair, with a caring dentist."},o=[{question:"Why are seniors more prone to certain dental emergencies?",answer:"As we age, teeth can become more brittle, existing fillings and crowns may wear out, and gum recession can expose roots to decay. Additionally, many seniors take medications that cause dry mouth, increasing cavity risk. Dentures can also break or become ill-fitting over time."},{question:"My denture broke. Can it be fixed quickly?",answer:"Many broken dentures can be repaired on the same day, especially if it's a clean break. It's crucial to bring all pieces of the denture with you. We aim to restore your ability to eat and speak comfortably as soon as possible."},{question:"What should I do if a filling or crown falls out?",answer:"Collect the filling or crown if possible. Avoid chewing on that side of your mouth. You can use a temporary dental cement from a pharmacy to cover the exposed tooth, but call us immediately for a proper repair to prevent further damage or sensitivity."},{question:"Is it safe for seniors to undergo emergency dental procedures?",answer:"Yes, with proper medical history review. We take extra care to understand your health conditions and medications to ensure any treatment is safe and tailored to your needs. We prioritize your comfort and well-being."},{question:"I have a severe toothache, but I'm on blood thinners. What should I do?",answer:"Call us immediately. It's vital to inform us about all your medications, especially blood thinners. We will coordinate with your physician if necessary to ensure safe treatment, as delaying care for an infection can be more dangerous."},{question:"My gums are bleeding and swollen. Is this an emergency?",answer:"Persistent bleeding and significant swelling can be signs of severe gum disease or an infection. While not always a 'drop everything' emergency, it requires prompt attention to prevent further bone loss and potential tooth loss. Call us for an urgent assessment."},{question:"What if I can't travel easily to the clinic?",answer:"Please discuss your mobility concerns with us when you call. We strive to make our clinic accessible and can discuss options or provide guidance on transportation if needed. Your access to care is important."},{question:"How can I prevent future dental emergencies?",answer:"Regular dental check-ups and professional cleanings are paramount. Discuss any changes in your health or medications with your dentist. Maintain good oral hygiene, and if you wear dentures, ensure they fit well and are cleaned daily."},{question:"Are there special considerations for seniors with cognitive impairment?",answer:"Yes, we approach care for patients with cognitive impairment with extra patience and understanding. We encourage caregivers to accompany them and provide us with as much information as possible to ensure a comfortable and effective visit."},{question:"What if my emergency happens after hours or on a weekend?",answer:"Our emergency line is available 24/7. Please call us, and our on-call team will provide advice and arrange for you to be seen if your situation is critical, ensuring you receive care when you need it most."}],h=()=>e.jsxs(i.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(s,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:n.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:n.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:n.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:n.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(t,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:n.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:n.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"As we age, our dental needs evolve, and sometimes, unexpected emergencies can arise.
