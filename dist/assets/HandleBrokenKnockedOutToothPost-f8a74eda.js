Learn the crucial first-aid steps to save your tooth and what to do before seeing an emergency dentist in Manchester.",author:"Dr. Ben Carter",readTime:"8 min read",category:"First Aid",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629904853716-f0bc54eea48d",imgAlt:"A person carefully holding a knocked out tooth, ready for transport to the dentist."},r=[{question:"What is the most important thing to do for a knocked-out tooth?",answer:"Act FAST. Time is critical. The best chance of saving the tooth is to have it reimplanted within one hour of being knocked out. Call an emergency dentist immediately."},{question:"How should I handle a knocked-out tooth?",answer:"Pick it up by the crown (the white chewing part), NOT the root. If it's dirty, rinse it briefly with milk or water. Do not scrub or use soap."},{question:"Should I try to put the tooth back in the socket myself?",answer:"Yes, if possible. Gently push it back into its socket and hold it in place by biting down on a clean cloth or gauze. If you can't reinsert it, proper storage is the next best thing."},{question:"What's the best way to store a knocked-out tooth?",answer:"The best storage medium is milk. Place the tooth in a small container of milk. If milk isn't available, you can use your own saliva (by holding it in your cheek) or a special tooth preservation product. Do NOT use plain water."},{question:"My tooth is broken, not knocked out. What should I do?",answer:"Rinse your mouth with warm salt water. Find any large fragments and save them. Apply a cold compress to your cheek to reduce swelling and pain. Call a dentist for broken tooth repair in Manchester immediately."},{question:"Will a chipped tooth in Bolton be treated the same day?",answer:"Yes, for a chipped tooth emergency in Bolton or Manchester, we aim to provide a same-day appointment. Minor chips can often be repaired in a single visit with dental bonding."},{question:"I need a dentist for a broken tooth in Bury. How quickly can I be seen?",answer:"We prioritize dental trauma. If you need a dentist for a broken tooth in Bury or surrounding areas, call our emergency line. We will arrange to see you as quickly as possible, usually the same day."},{question:"Can a tooth be saved if it's been out for more than an hour?",answer:"The chances of successful reimplantation decrease significantly after an hour, but it's not impossible. You should still seek immediate emergency dental treatment, as there may be other options available."},{question:"What happens if I swallow the broken piece of my tooth?",answer:"Don't worry. It's usually harmless and will pass through your digestive system without any issues. The priority is still to get the remaining tooth assessed by a dentist."},{question:"How much does knocked out tooth treatment in Manchester cost?",answer:"The cost involves an emergency consultation and the specific treatment. Reimplanting a tooth is a complex procedure. If the tooth cannot be saved, we will discuss replacement options like a bridge or dental implant. All costs will be explained upfront."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(o.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(n,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(i,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"In the shocking moments after a tooth is broken or completely knocked out, your actions can mean the difference between saving and losing the tooth.
