Paracetamol can also help. Always follow dosage instructions and consult a pharmacist if unsure."},{question:"Can I use ice for a toothache?",answer:"Yes, applying a cold pack to the outside of your cheek, near the affected area, can help reduce swelling and numb the pain. Do not apply ice directly to the tooth."},{question:"Is a salt water rinse really effective?",answer:"Absolutely. Rinsing with warm salt water can help dislodge food particles, cleanse the area, and reduce inflammation. It's a simple, effective way to maintain oral hygiene temporarily and provide some relief."},{question:"Should I apply aspirin directly to the tooth or gum?",answer:"No, never do this! Aspirin is acidic and can burn your gum tissue, causing more harm than good. Aspirin should only be taken orally as directed."},{question:"What if there's a visible hole in my tooth?",answer:"If you have a cavity or lost filling, you can try to gently pack a small piece of sugar-free chewing gum or a temporary dental filling material (available at pharmacies) into the hole. This can prevent further irritation until you see a dentist."},{question:"Can I use clove oil for severe tooth pain relief?",answer:"Clove oil contains eugenol, a natural anaesthetic. You can apply a small amount to a cotton ball and place it on the affected tooth or gum. Use sparingly, as too much can irritate the tissues."},{question:"How can I sleep with a severe toothache?",answer:"Elevating your head with extra pillows can reduce blood pressure to the painful area, which may lessen throbbing. Take painkillers before bed and avoid lying flat. A cold compress on your cheek might also help."},{question:"When should I stop trying home remedies and call an emergency dentist?",answer:"If your pain is severe, persistent, accompanied by swelling, fever, or difficulty breathing/swallowing, seek immediate professional help.
