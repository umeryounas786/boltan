Why an Emergency Dentist is Always Your Best Choice",description:"When faced with severe tooth pain, many wonder whether to go to A&E or a dentist. Learn why a hospital is ill-equipped for dental issues and why an emergency dentist is vital.",author:"Dr. Ben Carter",readTime:"7 min read",category:"Public Information",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586773860414-72476c3cce48",imgAlt:"The bright red sign for a hospital's Accident & Emergency department."},r=[{question:"What can a hospital A&E actually do for tooth pain?",answer:"A&E departments are not staffed by dentists and do not have dental equipment. They can provide pain relief (like painkillers) and, if there's a visible infection or swelling, they may prescribe antibiotics. However, they cannot diagnose the dental cause or provide any treatment to fix the underlying problem."},{question:"Why is going to A&E a waste of time for a dental problem?",answer:"Because they cannot treat the source of the pain, you will be told to see a dentist anyway. You will likely endure a long wait only to be given a temporary solution, meaning you still need to book and attend a separate dental appointment."},{question:"When SHOULD I go to A&E for a mouth-related issue?",answer:"You should go to A&E for severe trauma to the face or jaw (like a suspected fracture), uncontrollable bleeding that doesn't stop with pressure, or swelling around the throat or eye that is making it difficult to breathe or see. These are medical emergencies."},{question:"Can an emergency dentist do everything A&E can do for pain?",answer:"Yes, and much more. We can provide pain relief and antibiotics just like a hospital, but crucially, we can also diagnose the problem with X-rays and provide definitive treatment, such as starting a root canal, extracting a tooth, or dressing a fracture."},{question:"Will an emergency dentist cost more than A&E?",answer:"While NHS A&E is free at the point of use, it won't solve your problem. You'll still have to pay for the subsequent dental visit. Seeing an emergency dentist directly is more cost-effective in the long run as it combines diagnosis and treatment in one place, preventing the issue from worsening and requiring more expensive care."},{question:"My face is swollen. Is that a dental or medical emergency?",answer:"If the swelling is localized around a tooth or jaw, start with an emergency dentist. We can drain abscesses and treat the infection. If the swelling is spreading rapidly and affecting your breathing or vision, go to A&E immediately."},{question:"Do emergency dentists have access to strong painkillers?",answer:"Yes. In addition to prescribing medication, we can administer a local anesthetic to completely numb the painful area, providing immediate and profound relief that oral painkillers cannot match."},{question:"I have a toothache late at night. Is A&E my only option?",answer:"No. Our emergency dental clinic has a 24/7 on-call service. You can call us any time for advice. If your situation is urgent, our on-call dentist can arrange to meet you at the clinic for treatment, which is a far better option than waiting in A&E."},{question:"Can A&E pull a tooth?",answer:"No. Medical doctors at A&E are not trained or equipped to perform dental extractions. This procedure can only be done safely by a qualified dentist with the proper instruments and anesthetic."},{question:"What is the key takeaway when choosing where to go?",answer:"It's simple: for any problem inside your mouth related to teeth or gums, see a dentist. For major facial trauma or medical complications like breathing difficulties, go to A&E. Choosing the right service gets you the right care, faster."}],h=()=>e.jsxs(i.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(n,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(s,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"In the middle of the night, you're awakened by a throbbing, unbearable toothache.
