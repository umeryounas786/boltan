They may also test the vitality of the tooth."},{question:"Can a simple cavity cause severe tooth pain?",answer:"Yes, if a cavity is deep enough to reach the nerve (pulp) of the tooth, it can cause excruciating pain, especially when exposed to hot, cold, or sweet stimuli. This often requires an emergency filling or root canal."},{question:"What is a dental abscess and how is it treated?",answer:"A dental abscess is a pocket of pus caused by a bacterial infection, often at the root of a tooth or in the gums. Treatment involves draining the pus, often through an incision or root canal treatment, and prescribing antibiotics to clear the infection."},{question:"My tooth pain comes and goes. Is it still an emergency?",answer:"Intermittent pain, especially if sharp or severe, can still indicate a serious underlying problem, such as a cracked tooth or early nerve infection. It's best to consult an emergency dentist in Manchester to prevent it from worsening."},{question:"Can wisdom teeth cause referred pain in other areas?",answer:"Yes, impacted or erupting wisdom teeth can cause pain that radiates to your jaw, ear, or head. An emergency dentist can assess the wisdom tooth's position and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include extraction."},{question:"How can clenching or grinding teeth cause tooth pain?",answer:"Bruxism (teeth grinding) or clenching puts excessive force on your teeth, leading to cracks, fractures, wear, and jaw pain. An emergency dentist can diagnose this and provide temporary relief, potentially recommending a night guard."},{question:"What if my toothache is due to a broken filling or crown?",answer:"A broken filling or crown exposes the sensitive inner parts of your tooth to extreme temperatures and pressure, causing pain. An emergency dentist can provide a temporary or permanent restoration to seal and protect the tooth."},{question:"How quickly can an emergency dentist stop my severe tooth pain relief in Manchester?",answer:"In most cases, an emergency dentist can provide significant pain relief during your initial appointment, often by numbing the area, draining infection, or providing a temporary restoration. The goal is to get you out of immediate pain."},{question:"Is toothache always a sign of a serious dental problem?",answer:"While some mild toothaches can be from temporary sensitivity or food impaction, persistent or severe tooth pain is almost always a sign of an underlying issue that requires professional attention to prevent further complications."},{question:"What's the cost of emergency toothache treatment in Manchester?",answer:"The cost starts with an initial emergency consultation fee (usually Â£42). The total cost depends on the diagnosis and the specific treatment required.
