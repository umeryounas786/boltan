Learn the immediate steps to take, what not to do, and how our Manchester clinic offers same-day repairs to restore your smile.",author:"Dr. Ben Carter",readTime:"7 min read",category:"Denture Care",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625498542638-857fb3734d84",imgAlt:"A pair of dentures on a dental technician's workbench, mid-repair."},o=[{question:"Is a broken denture considered a real dental emergency?",answer:"Yes, absolutely. A broken denture can prevent you from eating and speaking properly, and wearing a damaged one can cause significant irritation and sores to your gums and mouth tissues. It requires immediate professional attention."},{question:"Can I use superglue to fix my broken denture?",answer:"No, never use superglue or any household adhesives. These glues are toxic and not safe for your mouth. They can also permanently damage the denture, making a professional repair impossible and often requiring a costly replacement."},{question:"What should I do immediately after my denture breaks?",answer:"Carefully collect all the pieces, including any teeth that have broken off. Place them in a secure container or bag. Do not attempt to wear the broken denture. Call our emergency denture repair service in Manchester immediately."},{question:"Do you offer same-day denture repairs?",answer:"Yes, we understand the urgency and offer a same-day emergency repair service for most types of denture damage, including cracks, fractures, and broken-off teeth. Our goal is to get your denture back to you as quickly as possible."},{question:"What kind of denture damage can you repair?",answer:"Our skilled technicians can repair most common issues, such as a cracked denture base, a complete fracture, a chipped or missing tooth, and adding a new tooth after an extraction. We can also perform relines to improve the fit."},{question:"How long does a denture repair take?",answer:"For simple repairs like a clean fracture or replacing a single tooth, we can often complete the repair within a few hours on the same day. More complex repairs may take longer, but we will give you a clear timeframe when you call."},{question:"Will the repair be strong and durable?",answer:"Yes. We use high-strength, professional-grade acrylics and bonding agents specifically designed for dental prosthetics. The repaired denture will be strong, durable, and safe to wear."},{question:"What if my denture is very old and keeps breaking?",answer:"If your denture is old and has had multiple repairs, it may be a sign that it's time for a replacement. The shape of your jaw changes over time, and an ill-fitting denture is more prone to breaking. We can assess its condition and advise you on the best course of action."},{question:"How much does an emergency denture repair cost in Manchester?",answer:"The cost depends on the type and extent of the damage. We offer transparent and competitive pricing. Please call us with a description of the problem, and we can provide you with an estimated cost over the phone."},{question:"Do I need to come to the clinic, or can I send my denture in?",answer:"You will need to bring your denture to our clinic. This allows us to properly assess the damage and, in some cases, check the fit in your mouth to ensure the repair will be successful."}],h=()=>e.jsxs(r.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(n,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:a.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:a.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:a.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:a.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(i,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:a.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(t,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:a.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"A broken denture is far more than a simple inconvenience—it's a genuine dental emergency that can disrupt your ability to eat, speak, and feel confident.
