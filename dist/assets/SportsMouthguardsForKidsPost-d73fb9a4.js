Learn why a custom-fitted mouthguard is the most important piece of equipment for protecting your child from sports dental injuries in Manchester.",author:"Dr. Anya Sharma",readTime:"7 min read",category:"Prevention",imgSrc:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579952516518-6c2027a0a135",imgAlt:"A child wearing a sports mouthguard while playing football, showcasing dental protection in action."},n=[{question:"Why is a custom-fitted mouthguard better than a store-bought one?",answer:"A custom mouthguard from a dentist is made from a precise impression of your child's teeth. This means it fits perfectly, offering superior protection, comfort, and stability. It won't fall out during a crucial moment and allows for easier breathing and speaking."},{question:"What kind of sports require a mouthguard?",answer:"Any sport with a risk of contact or falls can cause a sports dental injury in children. This includes obvious contact sports like rugby and hockey, but also football, basketball, martial arts, skateboarding, and gymnastics. When in doubt, wear a mouthguard."},{question:"What types of dental injuries can a mouthguard prevent?",answer:"Mouthguards are incredibly effective at preventing chipped, broken, and knocked-out teeth. They also protect against cuts to the lips, tongue, and cheeks, and can even help reduce the severity of concussions by absorbing shock."},{question:"My child wears braces. Can they still wear a mouthguard?",answer:"Yes, and it's even more important! A blow to the mouth can cause significant damage to braces and the soft tissues of the mouth. We can create a special custom mouthguard that fits comfortably over their braces."},{question:"How do we get a custom mouthguard in Manchester?",answer:"The process is simple and painless. You'll visit our clinic for a quick appointment where we take a digital or physical impression of your child's teeth. The custom mouthguard is then fabricated in a dental lab and will be ready for a final fitting shortly after."},{question:"How often should a mouthguard be replaced?",answer:"For a growing child, the mouthguard should be checked at every dental visit (usually every six months) to ensure it still fits properly. It will likely need to be replaced every season or two as their jaw grows and teeth shift."},{question:"How do we care for a mouthguard?",answer:"Rinse it with cool water after each use. Clean it regularly with a toothbrush and toothpaste or a mild soap. Store it in its protective, ventilated case. Never leave it in direct sunlight or a hot car, as it can warp."},{question:"Are mouthguards expensive?",answer:"A custom mouthguard is an investment in your child's safety. While it costs more than a store-bought one, it is significantly less expensive than the cost of emergency treatment for a broken or knocked-out tooth, which can require extensive and costly procedures over a lifetime."},{question:"Can adults benefit from mouthguards too?",answer:"Absolutely! Any adult playing contact or high-impact sports should wear a custom-fitted mouthguard to protect their teeth from injury. The principles of prevention are the same for all ages."},{question:"What's the first step to getting one for my child?",answer:"Just schedule a consultation with us. We can discuss your child's specific sport and needs, and get the process started to ensure they are protected before their next game or practice."}],d=()=>e.jsxs(s.article,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:.5},children:[e.jsxs(o,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:t.title}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:t.description})]}),e.jsxs("header",{children:[e.jsx("span",{className:"text-brand-red font-semibold",children:t.category}),e.jsx("h1",{children:t.title}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"blog-meta",children:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(r,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.author})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx(a,{className:"w-5 h-5"}),e.jsx("span",{children:t.readTime})]})]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"lead",children:"As parents, we do everything we can to keep our children safe.
